<h2>Project description</h2>
Gold Miner Online is the first online version of the beloved legendary game Gold Miner. The game has two modes: Online and Practice.

(+) Practice mode
There is a minimum score for each stage and your mission is to achieve that score. Winning each stage will earn you bananas (the in-game cash), so you can buy new useful support items. The difficulty will increase after each stage, so by purchasing items you can win the next stage more easily.
This mode is the same as the traditional game Gold Miner.

(+) Online mode
Create a personal account in the Gold Miner Online system and compete with other players. In the Online mode, two players will compete with each other to find the ultimate winner. Try to focus and use the support items wisely.
++ In the Online mode you can:
- Talk to other players in the Lobby
- Automatically find a new competitor
- Buy useful support items to help you in the game
- Express your emotion with Emoticon Chat
- Surrender and start a new game
