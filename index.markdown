I give efforts every day to learn about new technical knowledge and enhance my foreign language abilities as well.

Besides, scheduling detailed plans for every short-term achievement and always keeping persistent is my personal mission statement. Accordingly, to bear in mind to follow this way helps me self-research quickly and shape my problem-solving capability intensively.

For my working desire, I am passionate about Java and am willing to work with this awesome technology, but I'm eager to seek other techniques or solutions which could make better products for the customer.
